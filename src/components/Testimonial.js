          Volunteers are the supporting pillars of any student chapter. It is
          the same with ACM. In our student chapter, we have volunteers working
          under 5 teams: Technical team, Events and PR team, Social Media team,
          Design team and Coding team. Be it any event, our volunteers are our
          strength that make the event successful. Together, we celebrate our
          success; these teams work as pillars for ACM. By helping each other
          and appreciating others work, Team ACM moves forward. Vol List
